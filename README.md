# CBPD_MD_simulations
-Analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of CBPD-

This respiratory contains the necessary information to reproduce the MD simulations of CBPD and the analysis of the data.

#Restart files:
In this folder the input files necessary to reproduce the MD-trajectories can be found. The simulations are run using the AMBER18 code. The existing trajectories (100 GB), if you not choose to reproduce them yourself, can be shared by contacting asmund.rohr@nmbu.no.

#MD-analysis files:
This folder contains the input scripts for the program CPPTRAJ that extracts relevant data in text format.

#Plotting data:
This folder contains the text files from the CPPTRAJ processing of the raw data and the python script used to generate the figures.
